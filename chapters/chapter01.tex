\chapter{Context}

\label{chapter01}

This is a project developed in \textit{\company} and evaluated by the \textit{\univname} as a Final Degree Project.
\\\\
This project's purpose is to compare \textbf{user demand} and \textbf{flights provided} by airlines for routes. This comparison could improve flights advertisement according to user demand. The company could also develop complex software using the huge amount of data it will compare through an Application Programming Interface\cite{api}.
\\\\
\company\ have more than 75 million flights information and about 13 million users queries every day. In order to compare all the data available and get significant results, the software should solve  \textbf{Big Data}.

\section{\company}

\company\cite{skyscanner_strategy} is a travel fare aggregate website. It was formed in 2004 when a group of people was frustrated by the difficulties of finding cheap flights.
\\\\
In 12 years has evolved from a little office in the suburbs of Edinburgh to a world wide company with ten offices in seven different countries. In the next 5 years, \company\ wants to become the travel experience that people prefer to the myriad confusing and unconnected travel apps.
\\\\
Now, is one of the top travel fare aggregate website. It has more than 4 million visitors every day and, more or less, a revenue of half a million pounds per day.
\\\\
Before joining \company\ I wondered how they growth that fast and how they did this amount of money. Usually, \textit{if you do not pay for the product, you are the product}, so my first thoughts were that \company\ sell user searches, and travel tendencies to airline companies. \textbf{Companies know what travelers buy, but now what they have searched before their final purchase.}
\\\\
Once inside the company, I realized that it is not the way \company\ make money. Knowing that, when I joined \squad\ in Barcelona and had the opportunity to make the final degree project there, I proposed a tool to get traveler tendencies and compare them to \squad's data, timetables and flights.

This tribe\cite{marketplace_engine_home} is one of the most important tribes in \company, its mission is to provide the most comprehensive and accurate flight inventory for \company\ and her partners with minimum latency.
\\\\
Its main goal is to evolve the search, pricing, routes and browse services to be horizontally scalable and set us up to build a lightning fast, super accurate and fully comprehensive flight search engine, enabling the traveler to instantly find the best flight at the best price with minimum effort.
